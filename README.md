## Health Symptom Checker & Disease Prediction Bot

- This project aims to create an Health Symptom Checker bot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret symptoms and match them to likely conditions.

- The tool is built for educational purposes only, not medical diagnosis.

- The final application is deployed as a Streamlit web app where users enter symptoms and receive condition suggestions.
